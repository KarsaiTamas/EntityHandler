# EntityHandler
Gives you scripts which you can put on to the players/enemies/objects.
<br></br>Makes the entities savable and loadable.  
<br></br>Gives you a faster start up for handling entities.
<br></br>So far it has interactable entities, really basic script for AI, and for the player, which I may gonna add extra stuff into it.
<br></br>But maybe not too much stuff, because this was made to be a start up for ANY project which has to handle AI, interaction and saving.
<br></br>Not tested yet. 
<br></br>So far I am relying on the fact that when I add to a list the list item will contain the reference of the entity save data.
<br></br>Feel free to give me feedback, so I can make it better for later use.
